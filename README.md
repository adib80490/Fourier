# ðŸ›žDiscrete Fourier Transform of 2D Path

Inspired by [3blue1brown's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k) on fourier series, and [The Coding Train's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY4luNgGfms) on Fourier Transforms and Epicircles.
My implementation of the Discrete Fourier Transform is based on vector rotation and addition.
